A pool containing an empty text/plain and an empty
application/vnd.kde.kword block. These are used by
the HTTP web interface as the original targets
of new text and KWord document pointers.

When new types of documents are added to the
web interface, the corresponding blocks should be
added to this pool.

Usage: Simply make a copy of the bootstrap-pool
directory, remove the CVS subdirectory,
and use the result as the starting point
for your pool.
