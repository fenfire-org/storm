Tasks for storm

sometime for proxy:
  - URI decoding and encoding
  - HTML encoding
  - web form for requesting a block by URN

0.1alpha1: First separate release
    anybody:
	- port tests from gzz.

0.2: Development
    benja:
        - finish Storm redesign
	  - diffing
	  - move out of lava/
	  - PEGs
	  + multiplexing Storm pool?
	  + demo implementation on top of GISP
	  + asynchronous network lookups
	    + write PEG about existing interfaces
	- TOTAL UML documentation for all classes involved in
	  the save/load stuff, collaboration diagrams etc.
	  The path from structure to bytes and bytes to structure
	  needs to be ABSOLUTELY clear and transparent.
	- fix urn-5 application, which says "pseudo-random number (160 or more bytes)"
	  and 'SHA-1 assumes uniqueness of 160 byte identifiers"
	  should be bits!! Need to send version 1.1?
