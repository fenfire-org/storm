/** Turning on debugging according to gzz conventions.
 * The GZigZag convention for debuggable classes is that every class must have
 * a public static member dbg, e.g. as in
 * <pre>
 * class Foo {
 *	static public boolean dbg = false;
 *      ...
 *	private final void p(String s) { if(dbg) System.out.println(s); }
 *      ...
 *      ...
 *      void method() {
 *         p("Here");
 *         ...
 *         if(dbg)
 *             object-&lt;printDebugInfo();
 *         ...
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This member can be turned on from outside.
 * <p>
 * <b>Caveats</b>
 * <dl>
 *  <dt> Efficiency
 *    	<dd> Some Java versions, such as Kaffe 1.0.6, are not smart enough
 *		to optimize code like
 *			<pre>
 * p("AGG "+object+" "+object2+" "+number);
 *			</pre>
 *		so that the string is not formed if dbg is false.
 *		This is very unfortunate.
 *		If code like above is inside tight loops, a profiler will
 *		show that your program is spending a good amount of its
 *		time in StringBuffer code, making strings that will never be
 *		used for anything.
 *		Therefore, the above statements, especially in tight loops,
 *		should be changed to
 *			<pre>
 * if(dbg) p("AGG "+object+" "+object2+" "+number);
 *			</pre>
 *  <dt> Class garbage collection
 *  	<dd> Some (most?) Java implementations garbage-collect classes.
 *		This means that setting the static dbg value may not
 *		last if the class is garbage-collected and then reloaded.
 *		Because of this, Dbg keeps inside it a list of the classes
 *		for which debugging has been turned on.
 *		Therefore, <b>you should keep the Dbg object somewhere where
 *		it will not be garbage collected</b>.
 *		
 * </dl>
